# Vision-KAN
We are experimenting with the possibility of KAN replacing MLP in Vision Transformer, this project may be delayed for a long time due to GPU resource constraints, if there are any new developments, we will show them here!
# News
## 5.14.2024
We released our current Vision KAN code, we used efficient KAN to simply replace the MLP layer in the Transformer block and are pre-training the Tiny model on ImageNet 1k, subsequent results will be updated in the table.
# Architecture
We used [DeiT](https://github.com/facebookresearch/deit) as a baseline for Vision KAN development, thanks to Meta and MIT for the amazing work!
